Hi Support,
I'm using code like next
 
gantt.init("gantt_here");
gantt.load("data.php");
gantt.showQuickInfo(123);
 
where 123 is the ID of one of task in the dataset. Data is shown on the chart, but the quick info dialog is not shown, can you help me ?

Hi User 3
At first this method is defined in the Quick Info extension, so you need to activate the quick_info plugin.

Pay attention to the second line of your code, where you called .load method . You need to use  types 'json', 'xml', 'oldxml' .
